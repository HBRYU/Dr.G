Acne / Troubled Skin

Blackheads
Recommended treatment: Aqua Peeling
Description of Aqua Peeling
Aqua Peeling is one of the scaling treatments used for deep hydration of the skin, whitening, wrinkle improvement, and elasticity enhancement.
It involves the use of special equipment to directly infuse the skin with medicated or nutritious water (including AHA, BHA solution with keratolytic components).
It provides moisture and nutrients inside the skin, helping to restore and improve skin elasticity.
Treatment frequency: Consistent care at 1-week intervals is needed.
Treatment cost: The cost for one session is 110,000 won.

Milia, small pimples
Recommended skin treatment: Scaling
Scaling: A process used to cleanse the skin's surface.
Aims to smooth and purify the skin by removing various waste materials, pollutants, and desquamated skin cells accumulated on the skin's surface.
Uses a skin scaling solution to align the skin's turnover cycle (the period in which skin cells are replaced with new cells).
Removes damaged cells on the skin's surface, promoting the production of new skin cells and skin regeneration, thereby improving skin tone.
Helps improve skin conditions.
Treatment frequency: Consistent care at 1-week intervals is needed.
Treatment cost: The cost for one session is 110,000 won.

Pustular Acne
Recommended skin treatment: Gold PTT
  Gold PTT solution is absorbed into the sebaceous gland using ultrasonic vibration wavelengths, then amplified by the heat of the laser to deactivate the activated sebaceous gland → selectively destroys the sebaceous gland.
Treatment frequency: At least 6 treatments at 2-week intervals are required.
Treatment cost: The cost for one session is 440,000 won.

Oily skin with excess sebum
This requires a consultation with a specialist. Please send an inquiry or visit us for a direct consultation.

Wrinkles

 Expression lines
Recommended skin treatment: Botox
  Botox: A method of smoothing out wrinkles by injecting near the muscles of the wrinkles.
Treatment frequency: Repeat treatment every 5-6 months.
Treatment cost: Between the eyebrows 55,000 won / Around the eyes 77,000 won / Forehead 77,000 won / Square jaw 88,000 won.

Volume loss
Recommended skin treatment: Filler
Filler: An injectable used to fill sunken areas or add volume to the skin, often used for contouring purposes.
Treatment frequency: Repeat treatment every 9-12 months.
Treatment cost: Nasolabial folds 440,000 - 660,000 won / Chin tip 440,000 won / Front cheeks 660,000 - 880,000 won.
 Skin elasticity reduction
Recommended skin treatment: Ulthera
Ulthera: A treatment that uses ultrasound technology to lift and improve skin elasticity.
Delivers ultrasound to the dermis layer and deep collagen layer of the skin, affecting deep parts of the skin.
Stimulates collagen fibers in the skin, promoting collagen production and lifting skin tissue, thereby increasing elasticity.
Treatment frequency: Usually treated once a year.
Treatment cost: 400 SHOT (number of ultrasounds per treatment = 400 times) for 1,650,000 won.

 Decrease in skin elasticity and skin thickness
Recommended skin treatment: Double Tight
Uses high-frequency needles in the skin layer to induce collagen synthesis along with skin booster injection → makes the skin thicker and stronger.
Treatment frequency: At least 3 treatments at 1-month intervals.
Treatment cost: The cost for one session is 880,000 won.

Pigmentation / Freckles

Melasma
Recommended treatment: PiQo4 Laser Treatment
The PiQo4 laser uses picoseconds, a unit of one-trillionth of a second, to deliver high power in a short duration, selectively treating pigmented lesions without damaging surrounding normal skin.
Treatment frequency: At least 10 treatments at 1-2 week intervals.
Treatment cost: The cost for one session is 330,000 won.

Overall complexion improvement
Recommended treatment: Revlite Toning
Uses Revlite Laser
Employs various wavelengths to penetrate deeply into different layers of the skin.
Also known as Q-Switched Nd:YAG laser, it uses short pulse lengths to target pigmented cells in the skin.
Helps improve pigmentation and even out skin tone.
Treatment frequency: At least 10 treatments at 1-week intervals.
Treatment cost: The cost for one session is 220,000 won.

 Pigmentation
Treatment varies greatly depending on the time and color of the pigmentation. Specialist consultation is recommended.

Scars / Pores
 Scars:
Treatment varies greatly depending on the age and depth of the scar. Specialist consultation is recommended.

Pores:
Recommended treatment: PiQo4 Fraxel Laser
The PiQo4 laser uses picoseconds, a unit of one-trillionth of a second, to deliver high power in a short duration, inducing collagen synthesis and regeneration.
Treatment frequency: At least 6 consistent treatments at 2-week intervals.
Treatment cost: The cost for one session is 440,000 won.

Dry / Sensitive / Allergy

 Dryness:
Recommended treatment: Mirahil Ionzyme
Mirahil uses the principle of increased absorption of medication by ultrasonic vibration, integrating electrophoresis and ultrasound treatment to enhance penetration effect up to 40 times.
Treatment frequency: Consistent care at least once a week.
Treatment cost: The cost for one session is 110,000 won.

Sensitive / Allergy
Specialist consultation is recommended.

Moles

Recommended treatment: CO2 Laser
Carbon dioxide laser, uses a specific wavelength of laser light for skin treatment and improvement.
The CO2 laser uses skin vaporization technology to remove layers of skin and promote regeneration.
The CO2 laser delivers energy directly to the skin's surface, vaporizing the skin, which is then replaced by new skin cells according to the body's natural healing and regeneration mechanism → this process stimulates collagen production and remodels the skin, creating a more elastic and smoother skin.
Treatment frequency: Repeat treatment every 3-4 months, depending on the depth and lesion of the mole.
Treatment cost: 22,000 won per spot, with additional costs depending on size.

Freckles
Recommended treatment: Long Alex (Long Pulsed Alexandrite Laser) Laser
Long Alex (Long Pulsed Alexandrite Laser) Laser: This laser focuses specific wavelengths of light on the skin to improve various skin issues, especially targeting deep layers in the skin.
Does not directly destroy the melanin in pigmented lesions but causes thermal damage to melanin cells, inducing self-regeneration for treatment.
Treatment frequency: Single treatment.
Treatment cost: The cost for one treatment based on both cheeks is 660,000 won.

Milia:
Recommended treatment: CO2 Laser
Carbon dioxide laser, uses a specific wavelength of laser light for skin treatment and improvement.
The CO2 laser uses skin vaporization technology to remove layers of skin and promote regeneration.
The CO2 laser delivers energy directly to the skin's surface, vaporizing the skin, which is then replaced by new skin cells according to the body's natural healing and regeneration mechanism → this process stimulates collagen production and remodels the skin, creating a more elastic and smoother skin.

Flat Warts:
Recommended treatment: CO2 Laser
Carbon dioxide laser, uses a specific wavelength of laser light for skin treatment and improvement.
The CO2 laser uses skin vaporization technology to remove layers of skin and promote regeneration.
The CO2 laser delivers energy directly to the skin's surface, vaporizing the skin, which is then replaced by new skin cells according to the body's natural healing and regeneration mechanism → this process stimulates collagen production and remodels the skin, creating a more elastic and smoother skin.
Treatment frequency: 30% recurrence rate after CO2 laser, requiring repeated laser treatments. Consultation determines the frequency.
Treatment cost:
11,000 won per spot, usually performed over the entire facial area.
